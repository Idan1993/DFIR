# Network Evidence Acquisition
Acquiring network evidence from a system is an important part of digital forensics investigations.
Network evidence can provide valuable information about the communication and activity of a system, including data transfers, remote connections, and online activity.
This information can be used to reconstruct the timeline of events leading up to a security breach or cybercrime.
